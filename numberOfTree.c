Number of binary search trees = (Number of Left binary search sub-trees) * (Number of Right binary search sub-trees) * (Ways to choose the root)*/
/*Number of Binary Search Trees (BST) with n nodes is also same as number of unlabeled trees.
The reason for this is simple, in BST also we can make any key as root, If root is i'th key in
 sorted order, then i-1 keys can go on one side and (n-i) keys can go on other side.*/
